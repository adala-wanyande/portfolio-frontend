          I'm a software developer with a strong inclination for frontend technologies. 
          I enjoy creating tools that benefit society in one way or another and I love 
          to see my designs come to life through web development. I believe that we are 
          all creators and that we can all contribute to the betterment of society through
          our creations. I'm currently looking for opportunities to work with a team of
          like-minded individuals to create amazing products.
